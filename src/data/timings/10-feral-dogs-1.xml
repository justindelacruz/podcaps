regret everything. Welcome to Night Vale.</text><text start="35.92" dur="7.1">Our top story today: A roving pack of feral
dogs has been terrorizing Night Vale for the</text><text start="43.02" dur="9.1">past several hours. The dogs have been described
as mostly mutts, possibly pit bull mixes.</text><text start="52.12" dur="5.32">Witnesses say their apparent leader is the
three-headed one wearing dozens of decorative</text><text start="57.44" dur="7.879">service medals and chevrons. Sheriff&amp;#39;s Secret
Police confirmed that the dog pack has already</text><text start="65.319" dur="5.96">attacked a group of elementary school children
this morning, around eight, as they were getting</text><text start="71.289" dur="8.19">on the bus. Injuries were minor, as the children
protected themselves ably with their school-issued</text><text start="79.479" dur="8.111">nerve gas canisters and automatic pistols.
The dogs&amp;#39; motives are not yet known, although</text><text start="87.6" dur="8.72">authorities believe it could be meth and/or
gang related. More on this story as it develops.</text><text start="100.16" dur="6.199">This Friday afternoon, the Parks Department
will be spraying pesticide in all public park</text><text start="106.359" dur="7.76">areas, and in neighborhoods with dense foliage
and predominantly Irish heritage. Night Vale</text><text start="114.139" dur="6.28">is making a strong effort to reduce the mosquito
population, and the dangerous diseases they</text><text start="120.42" dur="9.6">carry. Last year, mosquitoes were responsible
for outbreaks of West Nile, influenza, panache,</text><text start="130.02" dur="7.9">elephantitis, and Fanny Brice Approximation
Syndrome. Please stay indoors from 1pm Friday</text><text start="137.92" dur="7.52">to 10pm Saturday to avoid dermal contact with
the pesticide-- which has been known to cause</text><text start="145.45" dur="8.56">skin abrasions, epilepsy, super epilepsy,
and organ inversion. The Parks Department</text><text start="154.01" dur="7.66">also notes that the pesticide has a half-life
of 2,100 years, which means we&amp;#39;ll be safe</text><text start="161.68" dur="4.04">from those annoying mosquitoes for a long
time.</text><text start="167" dur="9.51">We just received word from Wayne Tyler, Assistant Shift Manager at the new Pinkberry,
that the pack of feral dogs was seen this</text><text start="176.51" dur="5.9">morning rooting around in the dumpsters behind
the library. They made off with some discarded</text><text start="182.41" dur="8.02">Chinese take-out containers, a rusty futon
frame, and two homeless men-- likely to become</text><text start="190.43" dur="7.96">henchpeople to the wild dogs. If you are near
the library, be warned that these dogs are</text><text start="198.4" dur="6.87">dangerous. Also, be warned that penalties
for overdue books have skyrocketed to fifty</text><text start="205.27" dur="6.52">cents per day and, after thirty days, jaw
mutilation.</text><text start="213.76" dur="9.92">The Night Vale Medical Board has issued a new study indicating that you have
a spider somewhere on your body at all times,</text><text start="223.68" dur="6.36">but especially now. The study said that further
research would be needed to determine exactly</text><text start="230.06" dur="7.72">where on your body the spider is, and what
its intentions are. Only that it is definitely</text><text start="237.78" dur="5.72">there, and that it is statistically likely
to be one of the really ugly ones.</text><text start="245" dur="8.56">Let&amp;#39;s go now to Community Health Tips. Listeners: Are
you suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome?</text><text start="253.56" dur="9.27">Are you enjoying carpal tunnel syndrome? Are
you surprised by carpal tunnel syndrome? Are</text><text start="262.83" dur="7.8">you enraged by carpal tunnel syndrome? Do
you feel a throbbing sadness that you almost</text><text start="270.65" dur="7.4">cannot stand from carpal tunnel syndrome?
Do you feel a bounty of love and appreciation</text><text start="278.06" dur="5.98">for your fellow human beings traveling through
this confusing and finite lifetime with you</text><text start="284.04" dur="10.39">from carpal tunnel syndrome? Do you get sexually
aroused by carpal tunnel syndrome? That would</text><text start="294.44" dur="10">be weird. Not to be judgmental, but... it
would be weird. This has been Community Health Tips.</text><text start="305.6" dur="5.48">Listeners, we&amp;#39;ve just learned that the
drawbridge construction site has been hit</text><text start="311.09" dur="7.84">by graffiti vandals. The sheriff&amp;#39;s Secret
Police suspect the feral dog pack to be responsible</text><text start="318.93" dur="7">for the giant spray-painted lettering along
the bridge scaffolding that reads: GOLD STANDARD</text><text start="325.93" dur="7.8">IS OUR STANDARD and READ YOUR CONSTITUTION
There was also a very elaborately painted</text><text start="333.74" dur="7.56">portrait of Alexander Hamilton wearing Groucho
Marx nose glasses, and a caption that reads:</text><text start="341.3" dur="7.589">FEDERALIST PAPERS but where FEDERALIST is
crossed out, and TOILET is written in red.</text><text start="348.889" dur="7.381">Actually, you should see this. It&amp;#39;s truly
stunning. All that with spray paint-- I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="356.27" dur="8.399">impressed! These guys are really good artists!
Nevertheless, these dogs are possibly armed,</text><text start="364.669" dur="7.56">and possibly rabid. They are definitely Libertarian
street artists, and that has police and city</text><text start="372.24" dur="6.16">officials working double-time to solve this
problem. If you have any tips that could lead</text><text start="378.4" dur="7">to the capture of this roving band of dogs,
please, keep them to yourself. We&amp;#39;ve also</text><text start="385.419" dur="8.4">received word that they have tapped your phone
and computers, so best not leave the house, or talk loudly.</text><text start="395.04" dur="7.2">Let&amp;#39;s have a look at the Community
Calendar. This Sunday afternoon, the Night</text><text start="402.26" dur="7.6">Vale Fire Department will be holding its Bi-Weekly
Fire Person Appreciation Parade. All of the</text><text start="409.86" dur="5.18">town&amp;#39;s firefighters will be riding through
Main Street on their bright red engines, which</text><text start="415.04" dur="6.55">will be turned into floats depicting some
of the greatest fires in Night Vale&amp;#39;s history.</text><text start="421.59" dur="8.4">One of my personal favorites is the 1983 Earthquake
Dust Fire, when tremor-initiated fires became</text><text start="429.99" dur="7.92">so intense that the airborne sand burst into
deadly flames. Nearly the entire city population</text><text start="437.93" dur="7.88">was lost, and the FDNV does a fantastic job
capturing the drama with streamers and paper</text><text start="445.82" dur="6.379">mache. The Fire Department would like to remind
Night Vale citizens that the parade is free,</text><text start="452.199" dur="5.791">and to check your coffee makers and gas stoves
before you leave home, because they will not</text><text start="457.99" dur="9.04">fight any fires while the parade is happening.
On Monday, the staff of Dark Owl Records will</text><text start="467.04" dur="8.95">be wearing sweater vests. Tuesday night is
the Boy Scouts&amp;#39; Court of Honor. The BSA will</text><text start="475.99" dur="9.16">name its first-ever Blood-Pact Scouts-- the
rank just above Eagle Scout. So far, no scout</text><text start="485.169" dur="7.12">has attained the coveted position of Eternal
Scout, but we have heard that two local boys,</text><text start="492.29" dur="7.42">Franklin Wilson and Barton Donovan, have earned
the Invisibility Badge, which is a prerequisite</text><text start="499.71" dur="7.72">for the rank. Well done, Frank and Barty.
Wednesday afternoon is the city-wide Fitness</text><text start="507.449" dur="6.16">Fair at the Rec Center. Last year&amp;#39;s event
was canceled, as it was held on the same day</text><text start="513.62" dur="6.82">and at the same time as the Fried Chicken
and Cigarette Fair. This year&amp;#39;s event, however,</text><text start="520.44" dur="6">promises to be a huge success, as they have
secured a large corporate sponsorship from</text><text start="526.44" dur="7.32">The Intelligence Group International, who
will provide free prostate screenings, mammograms,</text><text start="533.77" dur="7.4">and surgically-embedded government monitoring
devices. Thursday morning, the National Weather</text><text start="541.18" dur="8.89">Service and National Security Agency have
scheduled a giant sandstorm. Friday is an</text><text start="550.07" dur="9.44">oasis. Only a metaphor for something unattainable.
A haunting dream of meaning for our lives,</text><text start="559.54" dur="9.34">but don&amp;#39;t look! Turn your head. Your life
is here. Stay here. You are alone. You are</text><text start="568.88" dur="9.36">so peacefully alone. That&amp;#39;s it. Yes. Goooood.</text><text start="585.16" dur="3.04">We&amp;#39;ve contacted the Night Vale Zoo, hoping</text><text start="588.2" dur="7.48">to find out more information on how dogs behave
in packs. Perhaps these skilled animal experts</text><text start="595.69" dur="7.63">could give us some insight into how to catch
these dogs, or at least understand them. Night</text><text start="603.32" dur="6.76">Vale Zoo Director Emily Munton told us that
all animals prefer tiny cages and scheduled</text><text start="610.08" dur="5.199">food pellet consumption, and that it didn&amp;#39;t
make sense that any animals would want to</text><text start="615.279" dur="8.48">wander freely about town. She added a high-pitched
roar, followed by a watery gurgling sound,</text><text start="623.76" dur="6.32">and then our conversation was ended by repeated,
cloudless thunderclaps.</text><text start="641.72" dur="8">A reminder to anyone looking for fun on a budget today in Night
Vale: it&amp;#39;s free admission day at the Night</text><text start="649.73" dur="7.06">Vale Museum of Forbidden Technologies. As
always, the museum features many fascinating</text><text start="656.79" dur="8.32">permanent exhibits, including the cheap, pollution-free
source of energy created by Nikola Tesla,</text><text start="665.11" dur="6.16">multiple time machines (some of them not yet
invented), and pocket calculators (which were</text><text start="671.3" dur="7.72">outlawed by the City Council 22 years ago
for undisclosed reasons). Along with that,</text><text start="679.02" dur="6.5">there is a temporary exhibit displaying the
many exciting and extremely dangerous uses</text><text start="685.52" dur="7.48">for lasers. Be sure to splurge on the guidebook
at the Museum Store, as the exhibits themselves</text><text start="693.02" dur="6.629">are entirely shrouded with thick burlap at
all times, and all explanatory plaques have</text><text start="699.649" dur="6.84">been blacked out with permanent marker. The
Museum of Forbidden Technologies. If you don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="706.5" dur="3.84">know about it, we may or may not have it!</text><text start="712" dur="3.24">And now a word from our sponsor: </text><text start="715.24" dur="7.48">You come home. The lights are off. You get an uneasy
feeling. Suddenly, the phone rings. You remember</text><text start="722.72" dur="5.6">that you do not have a phone. It rings some
more. You do not know what to do. Then you</text><text start="728.32" dur="6.06">remember that, yes, you do own a phone. Why
wouldn&amp;#39;t you own a phone? Everyone owns a</text><text start="734.38" dur="5.16">phone! The phone is still ringing. Ha ha ha
ha ha! How silly to think you didn&amp;#39;t own a</text><text start="739.54" dur="6.96">phone. It rings again. You smile, and shrug,
and answer the ringing phone. It is still</text><text start="746.5" dur="6.58">dark. &amp;quot;Hello?&amp;quot; you say. &amp;quot;They are waiting
for you,&amp;quot; a whispery, gender-indeterminate</text><text start="753.08" dur="7.48">voice tells you. &amp;quot;It is your time,&amp;quot; it says.
You turn on the light. You laugh again, wondering</text><text start="760.58" dur="6.61">why it took you so long to turn on the light.
&amp;quot;Gosh, it was dark!&amp;quot; you think. &amp;quot;Hello?&amp;quot; the</text><text start="767.19" dur="7.56">voice asks. You hang up, glad you remembered
to buy Tropicana Orange Juice, at least. Tropicana</text><text start="774.769" dur="4.68">Pure Premium Orange Juice is made from the
freshest oranges, with no added flavors or</text><text start="779.45" dur="7.16">preservatives. Also, you should get caller
ID! It&amp;#39;s the 21st century; how do you not</text><text start="786.61" dur="4.76">have caller ID? Really. Tropicana.</text><text start="796.04" dur="4.96">This just
in: two more schoolchildren were attacked</text><text start="801" dur="6.839">by the wild dogs this morning near the playground
at Night Vale Elementary School. One of the</text><text start="807.839" dur="6.471">boys was taken to Night Vale General with
treatable leg injuries. The other boy, we</text><text start="814.31" dur="6.72">understand, was unharmed, because he was a
better boy, and more loved by the Angels.</text><text start="821.76" dur="6.22">We&amp;#39;ve also received confirmation that a handful
of mangy curs broke into the Senior Center,</text><text start="827.98" dur="7.21">stole their televisions, and made the Internet
stop working. This has gotten out of hand,</text><text start="835.19" dur="5.86">ladies and gentlemen. We simply cannot live
in fear for our safety because of wild dogs.</text><text start="841.05" dur="8.12">Allow me a brief editorial here, if you would:
First off, please, have your pets fixed. It&amp;#39;s</text><text start="849.17" dur="6.32">an inexpensive and quick process. You can
take your dog or cat to the Night Vale SPCA,</text><text start="855.49" dur="6.87">to your local veterinarian, or to Big Rico&amp;#39;s
Pizza. Rico studies taxidermy as a hobby,</text><text start="862.36" dur="6.979">so he&amp;#39;s happy to help out in whatever way
he can. Second, many of these dog packs are</text><text start="869.339" dur="6.99">formed by dogs that are not raised to be loved,
but bred to fight. Trainers are teaching these</text><text start="876.329" dur="7.36">dogs everything from jujitsu to kickboxing
to knife work. This is simply unacceptable.</text><text start="884.48" dur="6.48">Dog fighting is illegal, cruel to animals,
and a danger to society when these dogs are</text><text start="890.96" dur="9.2">untethered. But we are a strong, united community
here in Night Vale. We must stand up to violence!</text><text start="900.16" dur="7.92">Our town was founded by peace-loving imperialist
conquerors who, to escape taxation, overwhelmed</text><text start="908.1" dur="6.27">a potentially violent race of indigenous people
and founded this beautiful city on principles</text><text start="914.37" dur="8.16">of family, fortitude, fence-building, and
friendly propaganda. Let&amp;#39;s not forget our</text><text start="922.53" dur="8.71">long-standing town motto: &amp;quot;We have nothing
to fear except ourselves. We are unholy, awful</text><text start="931.24" dur="8.88">people. Fear ourselves with silence. Look
down, Night Vale; look down, and forget what</text><text start="940.139" dur="11.7">you&amp;#39;ve done!&amp;quot; That is the motto of a determined,
unified community. And now, the weather! </text><text start="951.839" dur="289.44">[&amp;quot;i Know This:&amp;quot; by Rachel Kann]</text><text start="1241.28" dur="4.92">Ladies and gentlemen,
good news! Mayor Pamela Winchell called a</text><text start="1246.2" dur="7.12">press conference moments ago, declaring an
end to our dog pack terror. The mayor announced</text><text start="1253.32" dur="6.16">that the dogs were not actually dogs, just
some plastic bags caught in the breeze that</text><text start="1259.49" dur="7.25">people mistook for wild dogs. &amp;quot;There are no
wild dogs in Night Vale,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;And if</text><text start="1266.74" dur="7.42">there were, they&amp;#39;d be sweet little dogs with
big, meaningless eyes and tongues like flypaper!&amp;quot;</text><text start="1274.16" dur="5.2">The plastic bags, meanwhile, have been safely
returned to the Dog Park from whence they</text><text start="1279.37" dur="8.16">came, and which is to remain unknowable and
unremembered. Journalists asked about the</text><text start="1287.53" dur="7.399">injuries and aftermath of this morning&amp;#39;s dog
pack related crimes; the mayor responded with</text><text start="1294.929" dur="7.091">a hollow stare. She promptly shook the podium
off its base and whispered through gritted</text><text start="1302.02" dur="11.58">teeth, &amp;quot;Plastic bags. Plastic bags.&amp;quot; The Sheriff&amp;#39;s
Secret Police then ethically kettled the pool</text><text start="1313.6" dur="7.76">of reporters, gently coercing them with pepper
spray. Most were taken away peacefully in</text><text start="1321.36" dur="9.44">handcuffs and black hoods. Thank goodness
it was all a misunderstanding! Dear listeners,</text><text start="1330.809" dur="6.301">I don&amp;#39;t want to say I told you so, but wasn&amp;#39;t
I right when I said we were a determined,</text><text start="1337.11" dur="8.08">resilient little town? In the face of wild
beasts, we did not crumble, we did not back</text><text start="1345.19" dur="9.54">down. We stood eye to eye with violence, and
it blinked first. Stand proud, Night Vale!</text><text start="1354.73" dur="8.5">Be afraid on the inside, of course-- you are,
after all, your own downfall-- but stand proud</text><text start="1363.23" dur="7.78">against those predators that would harm your
family. And, that is our show! Thank you for</text><text start="1371.01" dur="7.39">listening, listeners! Stay tuned next for
