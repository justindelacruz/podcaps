PTA meeting ended in bloodshed as a rift in</text><text start="46.539" dur="7.56">space-time split open in the Main Street Recreation
Center Auditorium, setting loose several confused</text><text start="54.1" dur="6.029">and physically aggressive pteranodons. The
glowing portal remained open and shrieked</text><text start="60.129" dur="7.031">incessantly, an unholy sound that witnesses
say resembled noisy urchin children caught</text><text start="67.16" dur="7.2">in a combine harvester, and then slowed down
and amped up through some kind of open source,</text><text start="74.36" dur="8.72">easy-to-use audio editing software. The pteranodons
mostly attacked women with glasses. Authorities</text><text start="83.08" dur="6.74">are still unsure why, as Night Vale&amp;#39;s only
flying dinosaur expert, Joel Eisenberg, still</text><text start="89.83" dur="5.76">has not recovered from last year&amp;#39;s bout with
throat spiders. It took most of an hour to</text><text start="95.59" dur="6.46">corral the panicked beasts back into the vortex
and resume the meeting, which had mostly been</text><text start="102.05" dur="6.2">upon recent lunchroom price hikes, and had
devolved into name calling because Susan Willman</text><text start="108.25" dur="7">called Diane Crayton&amp;#39;s son Josh &amp;quot;a bit tubby,&amp;quot;
and that &amp;quot;maybe he needs a financial incentive</text><text start="115.25" dur="7.55">to eat a bit less.&amp;quot; In this reporter&amp;#39;s opinion,
Susan Willman is dangerously obsessed with</text><text start="122.8" dur="7.799">the New York Times best-selling Freakonomics
books. Dangerously so. Fortunately, no one</text><text start="130.599" dur="7">was injured or killed in the incident, although
experts from Timothy&amp;#39;s Auditorium Repair Contractors</text><text start="137.6" dur="8.5">Inc. estimates close to $750,000 in damage
has been done to the Rec Center Auditorium.</text><text start="146.1" dur="8.68">And that cost includes free storm windows
and a complementary seasonal installation consultation.</text><text start="157.08" dur="5.34">It&amp;#39;s election season again,
and you know what that means! Sheriff&amp;#39;s Secret</text><text start="162.42" dur="5.28">Police will be coming by to collect certain
family members so that everyone votes for</text><text start="167.7" dur="6.789">the correct council seats and there&amp;#39;s no confusion.
These family members will be held in a secure</text><text start="174.489" dur="7">and undisclosed location, which everyone knows
is the Abandoned Mine Shaft outside of town.</text><text start="181.999" dur="7.06">But, don&amp;#39;t let the name fool you, listeners:
it&amp;#39;s been used for years for so many kidnappings</text><text start="189.06" dur="5.73">and illegal detentions that the Abandoned
Mine Shaft outside of town is actually a pretty</text><text start="194.79" dur="10.05">nice location these days, featuring king-sized
beds, free wifi, and HBO. Also torture cubicles,</text><text start="204.84" dur="7">but I don&amp;#39;t think anyone&amp;#39;s going to make the
Council use those. Remember, this is America.</text><text start="212.44" dur="7.06">Vote correctly, or never see your loved ones
again. This message brought to you by the City Council.</text><text start="224.58" dur="5.4">The Night Vale Daily Journal
today announced that due to the recent economic</text><text start="229.98" dur="6.689">downturn, they will start running ads on the
front page. Any business interested in running</text><text start="236.669" dur="8.44">one of these Platinum Premium ads should contact
editor Leanne Hart. Hart mentioned that they</text><text start="245.109" dur="7.24">have also created a &amp;quot;Write Your Own News Story&amp;quot;
program for interested citizens. Because every</text><text start="252.349" dur="5.961">writer has been laid off, the Daily Journal
now needs these community contributions to</text><text start="258.31" dur="7.81">supply Night Vale with important news and
features. The first Platinum Premium ad runs</text><text start="266.12" dur="7.74">next Monday and features the terrified face
of an infant primate with a superimposed spoon</text><text start="273.86" dur="7.84">that has been stone-sharpened to a rough point,
and the tagline &amp;quot;Better use Tide.&amp;quot;</text><text start="281.7" dur="6.34">Hart also said that last year&amp;#39;s explosion that decimated the Daily Journal&amp;#39;s distribution plant is</text><text start="288.05" dur="10.12">still totally an accident, and would like
her insurance rep to call her back. Please. Call her back.</text><text start="306.76" dur="5.42">This just came across the wire:
The Secret Police have issued a new statement</text><text start="312.18" dur="7.18">shedding more light onto last night&amp;#39;s PTA
meeting incident. The noisy portal and subsequent</text><text start="319.37" dur="5.389">dinosaur attack that brutally interrupted
discussion of swing set repairs on the elementary</text><text start="324.759" dur="6.521">school playground stayed open long after Recreation
Center employees thought they had rounded</text><text start="331.28" dur="7.919">up all of the ancestral avian beasts, and
authorities warn there is still at least one</text><text start="339.199" dur="7.7">more pteranodon on the loose. Citizens should
cover themselves with a low-SPF sunscreen</text><text start="346.909" dur="8.32">and hide in a tiled bathroom. Several curious
handball players in the court next to the</text><text start="355.229" dur="6.12">auditorium actually popped their heads into
the portal-- just to see what was on the other</text><text start="361.349" dur="8.75">side of the vortex-- and came back dramatically
changed. The players aged several thousand</text><text start="370.099" dur="6.94">years in what bystanders experienced as only
a few seconds. Those handball players now</text><text start="377.039" dur="8.46">straddle the unenviable border of millennially
wizened and cripplingly insane. Since psychological</text><text start="385.5" dur="5.759">and emotional damages are no longer considered
valid claims by the greater medical insurance</text><text start="391.259" dur="8">community, we are still reporting zero injuries.
We&amp;#39;ll update you as further details surface</text><text start="399.259" dur="9.2">in our special ongoing and very special coverage of Pteranodon Attack-Gate. Are we safe from dinosaurs? No way.</text><text start="417.88" dur="5.06">City Council has asked me to read the following message: If you notice</text><text start="422.949" dur="7.68">strange auras around any of the following
objects in your house: blender, shower head,</text><text start="430.629" dur="10.91">dog, husband, wife, table, chair, doorknob,
baseboard, vacation souvenirs or photos, collectibles</text><text start="441.539" dur="8.2">of any kind (especially those depicting or
involving horses), DVDs (especially Cliffhanger,</text><text start="449.75" dur="6.479">There&amp;#39;s Something About Mary, and The Wire
4th season), and any bagged lettuce from California</text><text start="456.229" dur="6.66">or Mexico, please, report to the Council for
indefinite detention.</text><text start="463.94" dur="6.76">Speaking of the City Council, it voted this week to remove the
large lead-plated door from the northeastern-most</text><text start="470.71" dur="7.039">crook of Radon Canyon-- you know, the area
pulsing with green light and sotto voce basso</text><text start="477.749" dur="5.361">humming. Proponents of the measure called
the large yellow emblem and red lettering</text><text start="483.11" dur="8.01">that spelled out: DANGER: PLUTONIUM. DO NOT OPEN DOOR. RISK OF DEATH. ...were, at worst,</text><text start="491.12" dur="8.639">an offensive eyesore and, at best, a hacky
sci-fi cliche. Many Night Vale citizens attended</text><text start="499.759" dur="6.18">the meeting including, it was said, several
angels-- although no angel is admitted to</text><text start="505.939" dur="6.95">have been present for the City Council meeting...
or any other event ever, for that matter.</text><text start="512.889" dur="5.661">Old Woman Josie agreed with the measure, adding
that lead is a health hazard, and that the</text><text start="518.55" dur="7.36">old door was nothing but a ticking time bomb.
According to the meeting minutes, Josie said,</text><text start="525.91" dur="9.09">&amp;quot;That old door. Oooh, that door! Someone&amp;#39;s
gonna get some kind of lead poisoning!&amp;quot;</text><text start="535" dur="8.82">Carlos, beautiful Carlos, tragically shorn of his locks, reportedly was the only dissenting</text><text start="543.82" dur="6.8">voice. But it is not clear he actually opposed
the measure, as the minutes only report him</text><text start="550.62" dur="7.36">stating, &amp;quot;There is no time. No more time,&amp;quot;
into a black rectangle in his hand, and then</text><text start="557.98" dur="6.049">running, winded, from the Community Hall.
According to Old Woman Josie, he was still</text><text start="564.029" dur="4.78">absolutely perfect, and smelled of lavender
chewing gum.</text><text start="575.54" dur="3.38">More breaking news on the pteranodons.</text><text start="578.92" dur="6.88">We humbly offer the following retractions
from our previous reports: Secret Police are</text><text start="585.8" dur="8.18">now reporting that the offending beasts were
not pteranodons after all, but pterodactyls.</text><text start="593.99" dur="7.18">Also, pteranodons aren&amp;#39;t even dinosaurs as
this station previously stated-- just winged</text><text start="601.17" dur="8.49">reptiles that lived about 70 million years
after pterodactyls. Finally, earlier we reported</text><text start="609.66" dur="8.86">a death toll of zero when, in fact, the number
is closer to 38. We regret these errors.</text><text start="621" dur="5.62">It&amp;#39;s almost football season, and the Night Vale
Scorpions are gearing up for a defense of</text><text start="626.62" dur="6.82">the high school division title. But really,
as long as we beat Desert Bluffs, fans and</text><text start="633.44" dur="7.04">Hooded Figures alike will feel just fine.
Coach Nazr al-Mujaheed told reporters he&amp;#39;s</text><text start="640.49" dur="5.88">particularly excited for the progress junior
quarterback Michael Sandero made during the</text><text start="646.37" dur="5.07">off-season, after that sentient lightning
bolt struck him and give him the strength</text><text start="651.44" dur="7.46">of two Jeeps and the intelligence of a heavily
concussed René Descartes. But, if Night Vale</text><text start="658.91" dur="5.169">is going to beat their bitter rivals this
year, and stave off the government-administered</text><text start="664.079" dur="6.271">pestilence the follows a losing season record,
Sandero will have to improve his accuracy.</text><text start="670.35" dur="8.14">Last year, Sandero only completed two out
of 130 pass attempts-- most notably because</text><text start="678.49" dur="5.88">he was in advanced stages of cerebral palsy,
and because his throwing hand had been removed</text><text start="684.37" dur="6.899">due to several overdue library books. Apparently
the off-season lightning strike had healed</text><text start="691.269" dur="6.911">Sandero of his terminal ailments and court-ordered
amputations, and he&amp;#39;s ready to take on Desert</text><text start="698.18" dur="8.5">Bluffs, which is probably the worst team ever.
God, they&amp;#39;re dreadful.</text><text start="707.7" dur="9.28">And now, an editorial. Let&amp;#39;s talk for a moment about apartment building
etiquette. Now, I myself live in an apartment</text><text start="716.99" dur="7.17">building, and there is a compassion and acceptance
you have to have for a certain level of annoyance.</text><text start="724.16" dur="4.96">It&amp;#39;s people in close proximity to each other,
and so there will be some things that you</text><text start="729.12" dur="8.3">don&amp;#39;t like, and still have to let go. But
other things are absolutely unacceptable!</text><text start="737.42" dur="7.86">For instance, a certain level of strange radiating
light or heat on shared walls is expected,</text><text start="745.29" dur="6.979">but any oozings or visible membranes are rude
and thoughtless to all of your neighbors.</text><text start="752.269" dur="7.071">Gibbering, howling, and chants in long-dead
languages are the kind of thing that is fine</text><text start="759.34" dur="9.1">at 1:00 PM, but absolutely not fine at 1:00
AM. We are all in this together. Put your</text><text start="768.449" dur="8">trash in the cans, not in the hallway leading
to the cans. Put on some clothes when standing</text><text start="776.449" dur="6.401">in front of your windows, and keep any rituals
or crazed experiments to hours in which no</text><text start="782.85" dur="4.14">one is trying to sleep. It doesn&amp;#39;t have to
be hard.</text><text start="791.52" dur="3.88">We have a very unexpected treat today, dear listeners. </text><text start="795.4" dur="5.2">Live in the studio we have
one of the mysterious Hooded Figures often</text><text start="800.61" dur="5.779">seen around town. We did not actually invite
him here. He just was waiting for us when</text><text start="806.389" dur="6.07">we unlocked the studio this morning. He has
not moved, nor spoken since then, and I&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="812.459" dur="6.24">be honest: I am only guessing that &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; is
a he, because physical attributes are hard</text><text start="818.699" dur="6.601">to determine under these robes, and the face
is entirely hidden in shadow as empty and</text><text start="825.3" dur="8.08">as black as the void of space. But hey, we&amp;#39;re
doin&amp;#39; radio! He&amp;#39;s in a radio station. Let&amp;#39;s</text><text start="833.389" dur="5.7">see if we can get an interview. Mr. Hooded
Figure, how are you doing today?</text><text start="842.14" dur="2.24">Huh... okay.</text><text start="845.34" dur="4.62">Care to comment on the recent expansion of the Forbidden Dog Park?</text><text start="852.46" dur="1.32">Any comments at all?</text><text start="854.74" dur="5.4">Anything you&amp;#39;d like to tell the ordinary folk of Night Vale about your organization?</text><text start="864.78" dur="8.26">Listeners, I&amp;#39;m sure you can hear this. It&amp;#39;s not a problem with your radio
or our transmitters. The Hooded Figure is</text><text start="873.04" dur="8.7">making those noises in our studio. It&amp;#39;s pretty
deafening, actually. Alright! I don&amp;#39;t think</text><text start="881.74" dur="7.08">he&amp;#39;s going to stop, and he&amp;#39;s started to levitate,
so, let&amp;#39;s go to the weather.</text><text start="888.82" dur="275.4">[&amp;quot;Closer&amp;quot; by The Tiny]</text><text start="1164.22" dur="4.54">Ladies and Gentlemen, we have just
received word from Secret Police that the</text><text start="1168.76" dur="7.44">rip in space-time that opened at last night&amp;#39;s
PTA meeting has been sealed at last. The final</text><text start="1176.2" dur="6.92">missing pterodactyl has been returned to its
own timeline in either prehistoric or alternate-universe</text><text start="1183.12" dur="6.66">Night Vale. The creature&amp;#39;s lifeless body was
found a dozen yards outside of the Dog Park</text><text start="1189.78" dur="7.34">entrance, stripped of all flesh, and with
most of the organs inverted and strung around</text><text start="1197.13" dur="7.81">its exposed skull like an old fashioned soft
meats crown, as worn by the 18th century religious</text><text start="1204.94" dur="7.6">leaders who settled our fair burgh. The dinosaur&amp;#39;s
body was returned to the vortex, the gateway</text><text start="1212.54" dur="7.379">closed, and the PTA meeting rescheduled for
next Tuesday at 6:00 PM. That meeting will</text><text start="1219.919" dur="6.24">continue to address the important issue of
backpacks, and whether or not they are causing</text><text start="1226.159" dur="7.32">autism. There will also be a memorial service
for the 38 parents and teachers who lost their</text><text start="1233.49" dur="6.86">lives in the attack-- followed by a raffle.
Remember, winners must be present at the time</text><text start="1240.35" dur="2.3">of the drawing to claim their prizes.</text><text start="1244.3" dur="4.26">City Council and Secret Police have issued a reminder</text><text start="1248.57" dur="8.739">that Night Vale citizens of all species and
all geologic eras are not to enter, look at,</text><text start="1257.309" dur="7.571">or think too long about the Dog Park. This
reminder, they say, is completely unrelated</text><text start="1264.88" dur="7.86">to anything that may or may not have happened
today. Coming up next, stay tuned for our</text><text start="1272.74" dur="8.84">one-hour special, &amp;quot;Morse Code for Trumpet
Quintets.&amp;quot; And listeners, Night Vale is an</text><text start="1281.59" dur="9.31">ancient place, full of history and secrets--
as we were reminded today. But it is also</text><text start="1290.9" dur="8.82">a place of the present moment, full of life,
and of us. If you can hear my voice speaking</text><text start="1299.72" dur="11.1">live, then you know: we are not history yet.
We are happening now. How miraculous is that?</text><text start="1312.44" dur="3.16">Goodnight, listeners. Goodnight.</text><text start="1324.54" dur="8.5">Welcome to Night Vale is a production of Commonplace Books. It is written by Joseph Fink and Jeffrey
